This program is designed to accomodate Grandma Martha and her homemade pie business. She makes three types of pies: apple, blueberry, and peanut butter. 
She sells these pies to the local grocery store and makes a certain profit on each pie she makes. The prices to make and sell each pie are as follows:

   * Apple Pie:           $4.05 to make. $9.99 to sell.
   * Blueberry Pie:       $5.10 to make. $10.99 to sell.
   * Peanut Butter Pie:   $7.55 to make. $14.50 to sell.
   
Each day she can only make a miximum of 13 pies of each type for a theoretical maximum of 39 pies per day. This program will continuously ask Grandma
Martha what pie she has mad. If grandma Martha enters an invalid option, she will be met with an error. If she has baked 13 of a certain pie and enters
that same pie, she will be met with an error. Once Grandma Martha has indicated she is done entering pies, the program will calculate the total number
of each pie type made, total number of pies, and the total profit earned for that day. If she hasn't made any pies, the program will wish her a happy
day off.
