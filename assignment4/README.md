This program was designed to calculate the total cost of a certain number of items
at the Fenwick Clothing & Company during a 5-day sale. The discounts for the sale
days are as follows:

   * Sunday/Monday: full retail
   * Tuesday:       8% discount
   * Wednesday:     16% discount
   * Thursday:      24% discount
   * Friday:        32% discount
   * Saturday:      40% discount
   
The clerk first enters the day of week. Once they have entered the correct day of
the week with correct spelling, they will be asked for the retail price of an item.
They can enter as many items as wanted, and when they are finished, they enter -1
to stop the program. Once the clerk has entered all of the retail prices, the program
will print out a well-formatted receipt with the total number of items, total price
of the items without the discount, total price of the items with a discount, and the
amount saved from the sale.
