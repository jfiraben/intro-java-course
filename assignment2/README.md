This program was designed to calculate the total cost of a ticket at the museum. Each ticket
cost depends on the age of the patron. The cost breakdowns are as follows:

   * child 0-5: free
   * child 6-17: $2.93
   * adult 18-149: $8.65
   
There will be a convenience fee of $0.85 added to the price of the ticket and a sales tax 
of 10% also added. The program takes in to account the day of the week the patron visited 
the museum. If they visit during the weekend, the ticket price remains the same. If they visit
during the week, the initial ticket price is decreased by 20%. After the ticket is decreased 
by 20%, the convenience fee and the sales tax is added.

Once the program has calculated the total cost of the ticket, it prints out a well-formated
report with the customer age, ticket cost plus convenience fee, the sales tax, and the total
cost of the ticket.
