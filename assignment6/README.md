This program was designed to take the input from a user to keep track of the win/loss
record of each team in a Quidditch league. The user first inputs the total number of
teams in the league. Then the user will input each team name in the league. After all
the team names are entered, the user will be continuously prompted to enter game 
records for each team. The game record consists of the team name and either win or loss.
Once the user has entered all of the records, he/she will indicate they are finished 
entering. When all of the game records are entered, the program will output a 
well-formatted report containing each team name, number of games won, number of games
lost, and the total number of game records entered.
