# GMU IT 106 Course
## Introduction to IT Problem Solving Using Computer Programming

### Description:
> "Introduces techniques for developing solutions to business problems using procedural programming as an IT resource/tool. Students apply problem solving concepts by analyzing problems and constructing, testing, and implementing algorithms using pseudocode, desk checking, and procedural programming. Topics include: program flow, control structures, programming fundamentals, and integrating program modules into a cohesive solution."

### Topics:
> "On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
> * Discuss the importance of algorithms in the problem-solving process.
> * Identify the necessary properties of good algorithms.
> * Create algorithms for solving simple problems.
> * Use a programming language to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving problems.
> * Define and use data of both primitive and reference types effectively.
> * Create and use simple and complex static data structures.
> * Design solutions to problems using procedural techniques.
> * Decide on appropriate sequence, selection, and repetition structures for given problems.
> * Apply the techniques of structured (functional) decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces.
> * Describe the mechanics of parameter passing and the issues associated with scoping.
> * Apply effective debugging strategies."
